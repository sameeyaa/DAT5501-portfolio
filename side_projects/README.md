This is a folder containing all my personal projects I have been working on to develop my code.

This folder contains:
- A rock,paper,scissors game I coded to play when I need a bit of a break from complex code to refresh my mind and stimulate my brain
- A digital pet that I can look after and raise as a fun continuous game that I would not get bored of
- A project organiser which will help me in the workplace to section my projects and be able to easily find the details of each task I have received, who is inovolved in the project and any important dates

- I have also attempted to enhance my code by creating a user interface and visuals using tkinter as well as experimenting with branches
